# ECE128-Lab2
* The purpose of this lab is to design a 4-bit full adder which has three inputs A, B and CI (carry in) and two outputs SUM and CO (carry out) using previously built one-bit full adder as a sub module. Display the result on the Seven-Segment LED display of the Basys3 board. 
* This file only includes the Verilog file, its test bench nand constraint file
